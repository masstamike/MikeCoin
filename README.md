# MikeCoin Cryptocurrency
MikeCoin cryptocurrency is written in Go. It is a project to broaden my understanding of the Go programming language,
as well as learn more about the blockchain and it's potential uses. It is inspired by [Haseebcoin](https://github.com/Haseeb-Qureshi/lets-build-a-blockchain).
